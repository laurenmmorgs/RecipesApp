Built out an app that connects to a SQL database where users can login and register for the recipe share.
Using flask validations if the user already exists in the database, the user is prompted to login, and vice versa for the login portion. 
When signed in they are brough to a dashboard where other users have displayed their recipes, user has a chance to view the recipem with the date created, a description and if it is a quick meal. 
If the user is logged in they can view THEIR own recipes that was uploaded and has a chance to delete, or update the recipe. Real time updates seen on both front and backend.
